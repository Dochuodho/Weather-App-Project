API Key
This Weather App uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. To make use of the API, you need to sign up on the OpenWeatherMap website and obtain an API key.
Once you have your API key, create a file named config.js in the root directory of the project and add the following code:

javascript
Copy code
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
example in our code 
let apiKey= "0da1b2c6148eea77db878584a3f04e72";
